This is a Web3 app that fetches cryptocurrency price data across 
different decentralized exchanges and different blockchains.

Once fetched the price & cryptocurrency pair data is displayed 
along with from what exchange the price data came from.

A user can input their own trading pairs and see what those 
prices would be across different exchanges.

The data fetched would help users find arbitrage opportunities.
